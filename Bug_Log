Bug log
1. JLabel Image (right side) changes size depending on content of ScrollTextPane (left side).
FIXED: Set preferred size of both textArea and imageLabel
2. Node Parser cannot read NextNode if the description field is blank.
FIXED: Replaced description with 
    (this.description == null || this.description.isEmpty()? " " : this.description)
    in the toString method of all node types.
    
Ideas for improvement:
1. Import image
2. Edit nodes while you run project
3. Option to restart project at the end
